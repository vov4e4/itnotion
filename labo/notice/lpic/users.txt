cat etc/passwd
less etc/passwd
getent passwd       -+
  1. Username
  2. The encrypted password (represented by x, located in the /etc/shadow file)
  3. User ID number (known as UID)
  4. User group ID (known as GID)
  5. User full name
  6. User home directory
  7. The login shell (by default set to bin/bash)

Now that you have sudo, to change user you have to run this command
sudo -u <user> -s  
As you can see, you also inherit the environment variables when you use this command.
In order to launch a command as another user, you can also append a command to the sudo command.
sudo -u <user> <command>
For example, to change a user password, you would run
$ sudo -u john passwd
Changing user password for user john

Retype new password:
